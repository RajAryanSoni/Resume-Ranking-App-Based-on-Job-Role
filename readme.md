# Intelligent Resume Screening System with Bias Mitigation

This project implements an AI-powered resume screening system using **BERT (Transformer-based embeddings)**.
It semantically matches resumes with job descriptions while reducing bias related to gender, name, age, and education.

## Features
- Transformer-based resume embeddings
- Bias-aware preprocessing
- Fair candidate ranking
- Streamlit-based UI

## Tech Stack
- Python
- BERT (HuggingFace Transformers)
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
